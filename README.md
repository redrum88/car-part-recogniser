# Car Part Recogniser

### The **Car Part Recognizer** project is an exciting application of artificial intelligence technology aimed at recognizing different car parts from images and videos. The project utilizes deep learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to detect and classify various car parts accurately.

The Car Part Recognizer project has two primary models: a part detection model and a part classification model. The part detection model uses object detection techniques to identify car parts in images and videos, while the part classification model analyzes the detected parts and recognizes them based on their type.

The Car Part Recognizer project has numerous potential applications in various industries, including automotive manufacturing, auto repair, and salvage yards. The following are some of the possible usage scenarios:

* **Automotive manufacturing:** The Car Part Recognizer project could be used in the production process to identify and classify various car parts, improving the speed and accuracy of the manufacturing process.

* **Auto repair:** The project could be used to identify car parts that need repair or replacement, making it easier for mechanics to identify and fix problems with vehicles.

* **Salvage yards:** The Car Part Recognizer project could be used to classify car parts and sort them according to their type and condition, making it easier to sell or recycle them.

* **Insurance claims:** The project could be used by insurance companies to identify and verify car parts in insurance claims, preventing fraud and improving the accuracy of the claims process.

Overall, the Car Part Recognizer project has numerous potential applications in the automotive industry and beyond, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of organizations and businesses.
